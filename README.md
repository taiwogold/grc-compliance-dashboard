# 🛡️ GRC Compliance Dashboard

An interactive Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) dashboard built with Python, Streamlit and Plotly to visualize risk posture, compliance metrics, control effectiveness, and remediation progress.

The dashboard simulates the type of reporting used by Cyber Security Governance & Assurance teams to provide leadership visibility into risk management, control implementation, compliance status and remediation activities.
